    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy main dish, zucchini risotto, gets a splash of color by adding zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and
        basil.</p>
    <p>With much less butter than in a typical risotto recipe and no wine, there's no running around for ingredients you
        don't have!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 cups vegetable or chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 cups Arborio rice (uncooked)</li>
        <li> medium zucchini (thinly sliced with a vegetable peeler)</li>
        <li>10 sun-dried tomatoes (softened and chopped)</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried thyme (crushed)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan (or mozzarella) cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring stock to a boil in a saucepan, then reduce heat to a low simmer. </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Add onions; cook until softened, 2
            minutes. </li>
        <li>Add rice; cook until lightly toasted, 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually add simmering stock,
            stirring continuously. Risotto will become "creamy" and slightly sticky. When almost finished, stir in
            zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring continuously. When finished,
            the rice should be tender yet firm to the bite. </li>
        <li>Stir in 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and basil just before serving; divide among 6 bowls. Sprinkle servings
            with remaining 3 tablespoons cheese; season with black pepper. </li>
    </ol>
